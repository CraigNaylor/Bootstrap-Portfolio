# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is my portfolio. It was created to showcase my skills with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, as well as to allow me to market what i can do when looking for jobs in the web development job sector. It condenses all relevant information about me into one page, making it easier and more user friendly, as well as making it easier to market myself without sending out long wordy paragraphs and multiple links. 



## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)


## Usage

All buttons in the page can be clicked and they will link to the relevant external pags. Some buttons, such as the ones in the Navbar of the page will link to the relevant content listed further down in the page. 

There has also been accessibility features built into the page, press the Tab key on your keyboard to easily navigate down the page section by section.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
